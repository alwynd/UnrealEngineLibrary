<p style='color:white;'>Each JSON file in the UELibrary consists of arrays using this structure.<br/>To query the JSON, use PowerShell Where-Object (examples are included in the main form).<br/>Asset types are derived from Unreal Engine, so you can use PowerShell Where-Object to find unique asset types.<br/><br/>The PowerShell Where-Object query will run against all files in the UELibrary.<br/>Use smart, case insensitive searches when looking for specific asset types, such as 'assettype contains xyz'.<br/>You can also include logical operators like '-and' and '-or' in your search queries.<br/><br/>To refine searches further, combine these techniques with asset names, or even sizes (where the size is the number of bytes on disk).</p>
<p style='color:white;'>The following assets (and their thumbnails) were extracted and classified from Unreal Engine Projects:
<ul style='color:white;'>
    <li>Textures</li>
    <li>Materials (includes instances)</li>
    <li>Static/Skeletal Meshes</li>
    <li>Animations</li>
    <li>Blueprints</li>
    <li>Any other Unreal Objects included may not have thumbnails</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style='color:white;'><b>Query examples:</b><br/>
    $_.AssetPath -match 'spruce' -and $_.AssetType -match 'staticmesh'<br/>
    - look for all assets, containing the text 'spruce', where the asset is a static mesh.<br/><br/>
    $_.SizeOnDisk -gt 104857600<br/>
    - Look for all assets, where the size on disk, is greater than 100MB<br/><br/>
    $_.AssetPath -match 'combat.*sword' -and $_.AssetType -match 'animation'<br/>
    - Look for all assets, where the name regex matches combat and sword, where the asset type is an animation.<br/>
